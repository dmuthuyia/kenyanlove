				%h2 HOW IT WORKS

				%p * Someone looking to find love here at Kenyan love is first required to sign up. After signing up you are allowed to browse thousands of other people who are seeking to find love at our singles directory.

				%HR

				%p * Once you come across profile of someone you are interested in, read through to see if there are any matches in your interests.

				%HR

				%p * While at your interest’s profile click the send can-I button to express interest to date your “interest”. A can-I message will be sent to your interest who in turn after opening the message will be taken to your profile.

				%HR

				%p * If your interest doesn’t chose to ignore but instead send you a can I message, Kenyan love will arrange a date for you to meet up.

				%HR

				%p * Both the sender and the recipient sender will pay a small fee at varying proportions.  The sender will pay for the first date while Kenyan love will pay for 30% of their bill on their following 3 dates.

				%HR

				%p * Kenyan love will regularly follow up to see how the 2 carries out after the fourth date and they will cover 30% of the 2’s wedding budget if they get to that point.
